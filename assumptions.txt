Assumptions:
    'Sales' directory will be cleared once data is processed. I purposely don't clear it in my solution because i need the data to demonstrate that the program keeps adding the new data to the output(because the data is streamed to the sales directory).
    If no new data is added to the 'Sales' directory, it will keep adding the same data to the output.
    The reports in the 'Output' directory is stored daily, and the file name contains the date. all data processed on the same day will be in the same output file.
    SalesProcessing.zip will be unarchived in the same directory as process_sales.py,so directory structure will be:
       |-SalesProcessing
         |-Data
           |-Archive
           |-Output
           |-Region
           |-Sales
         |-process_sales.png
       |-process_sales.py
       |-requirements.txt
       |-assumptions.txt
       |-prerequisites.txt
       |-instructions.txt

    Directory Structure will remain the same.
    Data will always be in csv format.
    More files can be added to 'Sales' directory.
    The name of the region_csv will remain constant.
